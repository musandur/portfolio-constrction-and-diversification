This work is the supporting code of my blog in the medium platform. 

The blog is a walk through a simple mathematicla explanation of how a portfolio multi-factor risk model is build  and the how a robustly diversifed portfolio can be constructed from this model.  The portfolio risk and assets risk exposures are estimated  using five years of historical data from yahoo finace and the Fam-French five-factors model dataset.


The diversification process is based on the variation of the factor exposures according to the  Fam-French  risk factors. I name this approach as a Factor-exposure-based diversifion.


Diversification reduces portfolio's overall  risk exposure.
