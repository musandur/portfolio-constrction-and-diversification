This code supports my blog on the Medium platform, which provides a walkthrough of the mathematical foundations behind constructing a multi-factor risk model for a portfolio and how to build a robustly diversified portfolio using this model. The portfolio's risk and the assets' risk exposures are estimated using five years of historical data from Yahoo Finance, combined with the Fama-French five-factor model dataset.

The diversification method is centered around the variation of factor exposures according to the Fama-French risk factors. I refer to this approach as Factor-Exposure-Based Diversification.

By applying this method, diversification helps reduce the portfolio's overall risk exposure.
